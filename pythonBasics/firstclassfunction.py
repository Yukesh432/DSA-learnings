First-class functions are functions treated as first-class citizens (FCC) in a programming language.

FCC are "objects" which:
- Can be used as parameters
- Can be used as return values
- Can be assigned to variables
- Can be stored in data structures such as hashtables and lists

Implementing a custom map function in python

The built in map function in python applies a given function to each item of an iterable
and returns an iterator
