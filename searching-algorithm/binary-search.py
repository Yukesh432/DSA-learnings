"""Binary search repeatedly halves the search space by comparing the search key with the middle element of the list. This significantly reduces
 the number of comparisons needed to find the target element compared to a linear search.

- Faster than linear search for sorted lists.
- Time complexity: O(log n) in the average and best cases.
