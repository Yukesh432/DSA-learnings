<h2>This repo contains Python Programming language, Data structure and algorithms concepts and code </h2>

Python is a dynamically typed language. That means variable types are determined at runtime.

**Data structures:** Linked List, Stack, Queues


Linked List: It is a data structure used to implement sequence type of data. It consists of a node containing **data** and **pointer/memory address** to the next node.

- Unlike static arrays which allocates the contigous chunk of memory to store items, a linked list stores each items in a node.

- LinkedList supports efficient addition and removal of elements compared to static and dynamic arrays.

- Usecase includes: *Dynamic Memory Allocation(DMA)*, implementing *Stacks* and *queues*, *Polynomial arithmetic*, *Music playlist* etc.


Stack: 

Queues:


**Algorithms:**

- Searching Algorithm
    - Binary Search
    - Linear search
    - Interpolation Search
    - Bruteforce Search
    - MonteCarlo Tree search
- Sorting Algorithm
    - Permutation Sort
    - Selection Sort
- Tree
    - AVL Trees
    - B-Tree

**Algorithm Analysis**
- Time and Space Complexity
- Big-O Notation



**Dynamic Programming**

For a problem to be solved using dynamic programming, the problem must have two key attributes: **Optimal Substructure** and **Overlapping subproblem**

- Memoization(Top-Down approach)

- Tabulation(Bottom-Up approach)


**P vs NP completeness**
