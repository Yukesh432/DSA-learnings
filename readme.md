<h2>This repo contains Python Programming language, Data structure and algorithms concepts and code </h2>

Python is a dynamically typed language. That means variable types are determined at runtime.


Linked List: It is a data structure used to implement sequence type of data. It consists of a node containing **data** and **pointer/memory address** to the next node.

- Unlike static arrays which allocates the contigous chunk of memory to store items, a linked list stores each items in a node.

- LinkedList supports efficient addition and removal of elements compared to static and dynamic arrays.

- Usecase includes: *Dynamic Memory Allocation(DMA)*, implementing *Stacks* and *queues*, *Polynomial arithmetic*, *Music playlist* etc.



Topics: 
- Searching Algorithm
    - Binary Search
    - Linear search
    - Interpolation Search
    - Bruteforce Search
    - MonteCarlo Tree search
- Sorting Algorithm
    - Permutation Sort
    - Selection Sort
- Tree
    - AVL Trees
    - B-Tree

- Time and Space Complexity
- Big-O Notation 
- Queues and Linked List
- Dynamic Programming

For a problem to be solved using dynamic programming, the problem must have two key attributes: **Optimal Substructure** and **Overlapping subproblem**

- Memoization(Top-Down approach)

- Tabulation(Bottom-Up approach)

- P vs NP completeness
