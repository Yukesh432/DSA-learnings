<h2>This repo contains Data structure and algorithms concepts and code </h2>

Topics: 
- Searching Algorithm
    - Binary Search
    - Linear search
    - Interpolation Search
    - Bruteforce Search
    - MonteCarlo Tree search
- Sorting Algorithm
    - Permutation Sort
    - Selection Sort
- Tree
    - AVL Trees
    - B-Tree

- Time and Space Complexity
- Big-O Notation 
- Queues and Linked List
- Dynamic Programming

For a problem to be solved using dynamic programming, the problem must have two key attributes: **Optimal Substructure** and **Overlapping subproblem**

    - Memoization(Top-Down approach)
    - Tabulation(Bottom-Up approach)

- P vs NP completeness
